1.3.6 (2015-02-09): Added ng-strict-di for minification, renamed some files and folder lib to /vendors, moved directive into new /src folder for better separation.
1.3.7 (2015-03-08): Complete rewrite (but same functionality) so that I could add an Angular-Validation Service which is similar implementation as the Directive. Also added `debounce` attribute which is an alias to `typingLimit`, validation rules are now defined as an external service for better maintainability and also created a common file for shared functions by both Validation Directive and Service.

1.3.9 (2015-03-21): Added validation summary through 2 new and equivalent properties `$scope.$validationSummary` and `$scope.formName.$validationSummary`. Also added `bower` and `gulp` support, the Gulp script gives minified files.
1.3.10 (2015-03-28): Added new function of `checkFormValidity()` before submitting the form. Now use only 1 minified script instead of multiples.
